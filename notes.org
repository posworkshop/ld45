** stage/boss theme response

   each pickup of weapon/ability/upgrade will trigger a theme change in the next stage, and also alter the boss

   stage theme alter will be done in a way where the new weapon/ability/upgrade is designed to handle

   i.e pick a sword, stage will have packed enemies that also does melee

   boss will be the same, and it will also get a alteration that's a disadvantage for the weapon/ability/upgrade

   i.e same sword pick up will make the boss ... (to be determind)

collision signal used to see if "self" got hit and handle appropriately, should emit hit signal
